| Feature | Library | Framework |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| Definition | A collection of pre-written code you can call to perform specific tasks. | A complete structure that dictates the flow of your application and provides built-in rules. |
| Control | You control when and how to use the library. | The framework controls the flow; you follow its rules. |
| Inversion of Control | No inversion of control – you call the library. | Yes, “Hollywood Principle”: “Don’t call us, we’ll call you.” |
| Flexibility | More flexible, can be used as needed. | Less flexible, you must work within its structure. |
| Size | Usually smaller in size. | Usually larger, comes with more tools and features. |
| Example | jQuery, Lodash, NumPy | Angular, React (can be both, but often treated as framework), Django |
